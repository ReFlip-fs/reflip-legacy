# reflip-legacy
A version of ReFlip that was coded in like 3 days on the start of January 2022. please don't use this code it's really bad even if we did
# is this codebase still looks like reflip in both design and code
> Simple answer: Absolutely not.

> In details answser:

Even though we used this code as base for the current version of Reflip Server, the majority of the code has been entierly rewritten and only a few lines of code are from this old version.

To make it simple, don't think this version looks like the nowadays version of ReFlip.
# can i use this
Due to it having the Apache-2.0 License, theorically yes.

But we strongly don't recommand using this code due to it being extremly bad and having bad coding practises.
